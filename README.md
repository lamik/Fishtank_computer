My next generation fishtank controller.

 For now:
 - STM32F103C6T6
 - 4.3" TFT with FT800 controller
 - DS18B20 for water temperature
 - HC-SR04 for water level. I have some issue with steaming water in big amounts during one week. I have to control it.
 - DS3231 very precise RTC
 - SD card for measurements history (SD is not fully-working yet)

 No GUI yet. I want to test all periphelries first before design whole MENU.

 Plans:
 - Analog circuit for pH measuring
 - Dosin pumps system for fertilizers

 Maybe:
 - Bootloader for easy firmware upgrade
 - Bluetooth of WiFi communication
